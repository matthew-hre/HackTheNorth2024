# Tabifier

A utility to transfer windows between different computers

## Context

Have you ever been wired into a project? Deep in your flow state, you're coding away, plenty of tabs scattered around. You're in the zone, and then you have to go. You have to leave your computer and go to another one. You have to leave your tabs behind. You have to start over. You have to rebuild your flow state. You have to rebuild your tabs. Gross.

## Solution

Tabifier! Tabifier allows you to "push" your desktop up to the cloud, and "pull" it down on another computer. Not only does Tabifier save your tabs, but it also **saves your desktop layout**. The position of your windows, the size of your windows, the tabs in your windows, all of it. Tabifier saves it all.
